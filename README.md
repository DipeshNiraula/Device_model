# Comprehensive numerical modeling of filamentary RRAM devices including voltage ramp-rate and cycle-to-cycle variations
The set of files are the product of my PhD research. These matlab files needs COMSOL and livelink to MATLAB to operate. 
Executing them will reproduce RRAM device operation including SET and RESET process. 
There are three main files Complete_I_V which will generate average device characteristics, ramp-date dependency, and cycle-to-cycle variation. 
Please read the catalog for more detailed description including how to execute found under 3. Implementation.  
Note: One need LiveLink to MATLAB to run these files. LiveLink link to matlab is a COMSOL addon product which enables MATLAB to access COMSOL Solver.
Those who have LiveLink to MATLAB will have COMSOL Multiphysics with MATALB executable. Clicking this will automatically open a MATLAB linked to COMSOL.
